# Machine-Learning
# ML Algorithm from scratch in python
# Two categories :- Superviesed and Unsuperviesed ML
# Supervised ML :- Regression -> Linear Regression
#                  Classification -> Logistic Regression -> Binary labeled data
#                                 -> Multiclass Logistic Regression -> Data contains more than two class
#                  Desicion Tree
#                  Random Forest
# Unsupervised ML :-

# Each Algorithm folder contains three files, code_file -> contains the code for algorithm in scratch.
#                                             Example_file -> example to comapre the result of algo from scratch and algo from sklearn
#                                             Data_file -> contains the data on which both models are trained.
